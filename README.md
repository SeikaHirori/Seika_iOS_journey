UPDATE: 3/25/2023

Moved my progress onto my GitHub Page: [https://seikahirori.github.io/](https://seikahirori.github.io/)
- Reason: There's better automation of updating my iOS journey on my personal website.

---

- This will contain my progress as I learn iOS development. It consists of both completed and work-in-progress (WIP) projects. It also consists of learning materials, resources, and personal notes I have uesd during my progress!

- At 7pm UTC, GitHub Actions will automatically update the submodules if there are updates to them. This is to streamline the process of linking to the various folders and files.

- I write up my progress with iOS development, which can be found here:
